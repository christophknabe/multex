# MulTEx - The Multi-Tier Exception Handling Framework
MulTEx is a simple, but powerful framework for organizing exceptions and user messages in a multi-tier Java software system.

## Features
* Internationalizable message texts and parameters for exceptions
* Causal chains/trees as a means to capture low-level error information
* A standard way for writing method bodies with regard to exceptions
* Services for reporting an exception in a nice textual format with its causal chain/tree
* Redundancy-free stack traces in the case of indirectly caused exceptions

## Documentation
Online documentation is step-by-step being migrated to directory [docs](docs),
as the traditional publishing service at http://public.bht-berlin.de/~knabe/java/multex/
is not always available.
