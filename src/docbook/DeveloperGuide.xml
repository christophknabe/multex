  <para>In this developer's guide we describe, with which tools and how the
  software is maintained.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Tools Used</title>

    <section>
      <title>Programming Tools</title>

      <para>The build process is managed by Maven 2.</para>

      <title>Documentation Tools</title>

      <para>The two textual documents (technical paper
      <filename>Konzepte.pdf</filename>, and slides
      <filename>Vortragsfolien.pdf</filename>) are still in german language,
      and edited in OpenOffice.</para>

      <para>They must be transformed to PDF manually, and then stored manually
      to the directory <filename>src\site\resources</filename></para>

      <para>The User's and the Developer's Guide are already edited as DocBook
      XML files in the directory <filename>src\docbook</filename>. See <ulink
      url="http://www.docbook.org/">http://www.docbook.org/</ulink>. This
      format is especially useful for being managed by a versioning system,
      and for generating output for different targets, for example web sites,
      and printed books.</para>

      <para>You can edit it in an XML-aware text editor, as in the open source
      jEdit with it's XML plugin, or with a dedicated DocBook XML editor, as
      the XMLmind XML Editor, see <ulink
      url="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/">http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/</ulink>.
      The latter is much more comfortable. It is free for non-commercial
      use.</para>

      <para>The DocBook documents are transformed to HTML and PDF by the
      docbook-maven-plugin for Maven 2, which is located at <ulink
      url="http://mojo.codehaus.org/docbook-maven-plugin/">http://mojo.codehaus.org/docbook-maven-plugin/</ulink>.
      The released alpha version 1.0.0 did not work, so we had to use the
      snapshot from <ulink
      url="http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org/">http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org/</ulink>.</para>

      <para>The command for generating the HTML and PDF output is:</para>

      <para><programlisting>mvn org.codehaus.mojo:docbook-maven-plugin:transform</programlisting>The
      documents are generated into the
      <filename>target\site\docbook</filename> directory. From file
      <filename>src\site\site.xml</filename> you can link to them.</para>
